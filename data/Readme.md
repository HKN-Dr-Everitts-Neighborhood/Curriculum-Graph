data
=======

Do not modify links.json directly.

* raw_data.json user-inputed data
* links.json data for linking to the wiki, generated by data_scrapers/links.py
* prepare.py combines links.json and raw_data.json into data.json (one level up).

raw_data.json
===============

This file contains all hand-specified data - the courses in this file are the ones that will be graphed / included in tech electives by subfields / etc.

The file is organized much like data.json: it's a list of json objects, each representing a class.  All have the "name", "title", "type", "prereqs", and "coreqs" attributes that will appear in data.json.  "link_fallback" is an optional field - if it is present, it specifies the name of the class to fall back on when looking for a link (e.g. this is used for CHEM 103 to point to CHEM 102, since they are in a combined page on the wiki).  Some more fields in this file (which are carried over to data.json) are "nocredit" (courses for which you can't also get credit for), "subfield" (for courses of various Tech Elective types) and "crosslist" (use for crosslisted courses).
